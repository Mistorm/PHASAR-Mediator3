#### ReadMe for Mediator 3 ####

INTRO:
Mediator 3 is part of PHASAR and works with the Dungeons & Dragons interface and the Twistinator server. The mediator was written by 
Bart van Zeeland during his final internship at the Raboud university.  It accepts queries from a 
client in JSON format and convert the queries to something the server can handle. It sends this server query, transforms the answer 
and sends it back in JSON format to the client. The mediator allows for two kinds of JSON requests: a normal query and a suggestion 
request.
When it receives a normal request, the mediator only transforms the query and reformats the result. A suggestion 
request is a more complex opperation: upon receivinf, the mediator wil send out two queries to the server, compare the result, calculate 
the number of times a hit is generated and send the result back in JSON format.

JSON EXAMPLES:

Normal query: {"boxes":[{"nr":"0", "content":"bank"},{"nr":"1", "content":"nederlandsche"},{"nr":"4", "content":"worden"}], "arrows":[{"a":"0", "relator":"ATTR", "b":"1", "direction":"1"},{"a":"0", "relator":"SUBJ", "b":"4", "direction":"4"}]}
Normal answer: "result":[{"content":"Uit processtukken rond de afwikkeling van de kwestie blijkt dat De Nederlandsche Bank jarenlang door de top van CLBN een rad voor ogen werd gedraaid.","triples":["MEN SUBJ draaien","afwikkeling PREPvan kwestie","bank ATTR nederlandsche","bank SUBJ worden","draaien PREPuit processtukken","processtukken PREPrond afwikkeling","rad PREPvoor ogen","top PREPvan CLBN","worden MOD jarenlang","worden PRED rad","worden PREPdoor top"]}]}

Suggestion Request: {"query":{"boxes":[{"nr":"0", "content":"bank"},{"nr":"1", "content":"nederlandsche"},], "arrows":[{"a":"0", "relator":"ATTR", "b":"1", "direction":"1"},]},"box":{"nr":"1", "content":"nederlandsche"}}
Suggestion Answer: {"suggestion":[{"count":"*","value":"*"},{"count":55,"value":"centrale"},{"count":26,"value":"nederlandsche"},{"count":16,"value":"europese"},{"count":10,"value":"duitse"},{"count":5,"value":"toekomstige"},{"count":4,"value":"britse"},{"count":3,"value":"andere"},{"count":2,"value":"zwitserse"},{"count":2,"value":"toezichthoudende"},{"count":2,"value":"onafhankelijke"},{"count":2,"value":"nieuwe"},{"count":2,"value":"middelgrote"},{"count":2,"value":"japanse"},{"count":2,"value":"grootste"},{"count":2,"value":"generale"},{"count":2,"value":"belgische"},{"count":1,"value":"zat"},{"count":1,"value":"vierde"},{"count":1,"value":"regionale"},{"count":1,"value":"overkoepelende"},{"count":1,"value":"nederlandse"},{"count":1,"value":"nauwlettend"},{"count":1,"value":"lokale"},{"count":1,"value":"komende"},{"count":1,"value":"gemeenschappelijke"},{"count":1,"value":"franse"},{"count":1,"value":"enige"},{"count":1,"value":"ene"},{"count":1,"value":"eerste"},{"count":1,"value":"bekende"},{"count":1,"value":"bekend"},{"count":1,"value":"amerikaanse"}]}


IMPORTAINT NOTICES:
- The internal framework of the mediator supports the adding of a cache in two places though this is currently not implemented. There 
are even mockup classes of the caches in use.
- The mediator uses a few frameworks to provide a web based JSON api and acces to the server (Twistinator). To compile the software, 
a Maven build is recommended for easy dependency handeling. An example pom.xml Maven configuration file can be found in the 
repository. The mediator was build using a Maven project in Netbeans.
- The mediator uses classes from the Twistinator server to communicate with the server. Since the default Twistinator isn't build 
using Maven and Netbeans doesn't allow non-Maven imports in a Maven project, a Maven based port was made. The pom.xml file for this 
build is also included in the mediator repository (twistinator.pom.example).
- The server must in order tp preform the mediator unit tests. Some of the unit tests may fail due to a mismatch between the data in the server and a the answer the test expects. 
- The mediator logs information when handeling a query, this may be usefull when debugging.
